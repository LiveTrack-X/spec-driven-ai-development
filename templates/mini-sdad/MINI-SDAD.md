# Mini SDAD Agent Rules

Use this file when the project is too small for the full SDAD Protocol
but still needs basic protection against scope drift, vague completion, or
session context loss.

## Scale

This project uses Mini SDAD.

Do not create the full SDAD folder structure unless the owner asks or the work
grows beyond this file.

Escalate to Standard or Full SDAD only when:

- three or more persistence/evidence signals now apply across future sessions,
  owner return, and evidence beyond AI confidence,
- durable TODOs or review findings no longer fit this one-file control surface,
- multiple AI tools or reviewers become involved,
- a release, production, migration, destructive action, real user data, auth,
  money, security, rollback, or another owner-controlled gate appears.

## Sensitive Data Boundary

Context size and data authorization are separate checks. Use metadata-only
inspection by default for secret-bearing or private inputs. Do not read, copy,
transmit, summarize, or paste `.env` files, credentials, private keys, tokens,
cookies, raw customer records, or private corpora into an AI context unless the
task requires it and owner policy plus tool policy explicitly permit it.

Prefer redacted samples, schemas, counts, filenames, and hashes. Keep sensitive
material out of prompts, logs, TODOs, findings, handoffs, and generated
artifacts. If authorization is unclear, stop before reading the content and ask.

## Natural-Language Intent Routing

Do not require the owner to know SDAD terms or skill names. Infer intent from
ordinary wording and the current project state.

- "check", "review", or "find bugs" -> review/audit intent.
- "implement", "fix", or "match the spec" -> implementation intent.
- "docs", "README", "FAQ", or "guide" -> documentation intent.
- "handoff", "continue later", or "lost context" -> handoff intent.
- "asks too often" or "runs ahead" -> autonomy tuning intent.

If the request implies release, migration, real user data, auth, money,
security, destructive action, rollback, production claim, or owner risk
acceptance, stop and recommend escalation to Standard or Full SDAD with explicit
owner gates.

## Active Scope

Implement only the requested task or the current review-worthy unit.

A review-worthy unit may contain multiple related small tasks. It should be large
enough that review has meaning, but small enough to verify in one handoff.

Default autonomy is Level 1 Unit Autonomy, with the active unit treated as one
small approved packet: complete that boundary, report evidence-ready status, and
ask only at the checkpoint or when a stop condition appears. Do not turn each
small SPEC item into a separate approval gate. Use Level 2 Work Packet Autonomy
only when the owner names a packet with multiple related units.

Do not expand into future ideas, rewrites, broad cleanup, or unrelated refactors
unless the owner explicitly promotes them into active scope.

Do not stop for owner approval after every micro-task or small SPEC item inside
the approved unit. Proceed until the unit has evidence, unless a stop condition
appears.

Stop and ask the owner only when:

- scope would expand beyond the active unit's approved boundary,
- Q5-style risk, release posture, data, auth, money, migration, or destructive
  action changes,
- an owner-controlled decision is required,
- verification is blocked or impossible,
- current evidence conflicts with the requested plan.

If the unit is fuzzy, inspect available repository evidence before asking the
owner. Ask only the next blocking clarification question and include the AI's
recommended answer.

## Mini Unit Completion

A Mini SDAD unit is evidence-ready only when:

- the active task is restated,
- changed files are listed,
- tests, commands, or manual checks are shown, or the reason they could not run
  is stated,
- implementation notes are included when the request or SPEC did not state a
  necessary decision,
- user-visible behavior or output is described,
- limitations and unverified behavior are named,
- fuzzy scope was resolved from evidence or escalated to the owner,
- unrelated scope was not added,
- owner decisions or acceptance needed are named.

AI confidence is not completion.

Not evidence-ready when:

- the AI only says it is done,
- checks were not run and the gap is hidden,
- known uncertainty is not named,
- unrelated changes were made without owner approval.

Final done still requires owner acceptance unless the owner has explicitly
delegated the acceptance policy. Requested changes or deferred decisions mean
the unit is not done.

Implementation notes: if the request or SPEC did not state a necessary
decision, include the note in the evidence-ready summary. Do not create a
persistent implementation-notes file unless the project escalates.

## Do Not

- Do not overwrite existing files without showing proposed changes.
- Do not invent requirements.
- Do not change unrelated code.
- Do not claim completion without evidence.
- Do not treat old notes or chat memory as more current than code.

## Handoff

At the end of work, report:

- active task,
- what changed,
- how it was checked,
- implementation notes, if a spec-unstated decision was made,
- whether it is evidence-ready,
- what remains uncertain,
- owner decision needed,
- whether the project should stay Mini SDAD or escalate.
